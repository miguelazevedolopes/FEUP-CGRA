## Aditional Features

To catch a stone, the fish must be in the position as close to the sand as possible (press L until it doesn't move any further). when you are close to the stone, just press C to pick it up.

To throw a stone towards the nest (sea shell surrounded by rocks) you must be at the highest point that is allowed (press P until the fish doesn't move anymore) and be 5 units away from the center of the fish's nest. As such, we recommend that you start from a distance greater than 5 and press the C key repeatedly.

As suggested by the teacher of the practical classes, in an attempt to improve performance we tried to reuse the same shader for all the fish, however, we did not see any improvement and as such we kept the textures of the different fish, as you can see in the screenshots that follow:
